The objective of this project is to analyze YouTube video data in order to uncover the key drivers of content performance and audience engagement. Specifically, the analysis seeks to:
Identify which video categories (e.g., Gaming, Comedy, News) receive the highest engagement in terms of views, likes, and comments.
Evaluate whether video duration or resolution influences engagement metrics.
Explore whether video popularity can be predicted using metadata features.
Assess whether videos with hashtags perform better than those without in terms of views, likes, and engagement rate.
Discover which hashtags are most frequently associated with viral videos and how they contribute to content success.
