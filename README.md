Objectives: 
The objective of this project is to perform an end-to-end analysis of YouTube video data (17,590 rows) using Python, ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and consistency through data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
The analysis focuses on deriving key performance indicators (KPIs) and generating actionable business insights by addressing critical questions, including:

Which video categories receive the highest engagement and views?

How do video duration and resolution influence engagement metrics?

Which categories are consistently high-performing or underperforming?

Do hashtags improve video performance, and which hashtags are most linked to viral videos?

The ultimate goal is to transform raw YouTube metadata into a cleaned, structured, and insight-rich dataset, enabling content creators, marketers, and platform stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

Dataset:

KPI/Questions:
1. Identify which video categories (e.g., Gaming, Comedy, News) receive the highest engagement in terms of views, likes, and comments.
2. Evaluate whether video duration or resolution influences engagement metrics.
3. Explore whether video popularity can be predicted using metadata features.
4. Assess whether videos with hashtags perform better than those without in terms of views, likes, and engagement rate.
5. Discover which hashtags are most frequently associated with viral videos and how they contribute to content success.

Executive Summary
Categories: Gaming & Comedy dominate in views, but Education has stronger engagement efficiency.
Duration: Medium-length videos (4â€“10 minutes) perform best for engagement.
Resolution: HD videos (720p/1080p) yield slightly higher engagement than low-quality formats.
Predictors: Likes and Comments are the strongest indicators of video success.
Hashtags: Videos with hashtags consistently achieve higher engagement; most viral videos use them.
Viral Content: A small share of videos goes viral, but these drive massive spikes in reach and engagement.
